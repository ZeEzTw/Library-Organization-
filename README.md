Created in 2023

This app was created to organize my home library, offering a simple and efficient way to keep track of books. Users can add books to virtual shelves, each with details like the author and title. If a shelf has two rows of books, the app allows placing books behind the visible ones for a more detailed organization.

All the information is saved in the app, and when reopened, the shelves remain organized exactly as they were left. Additionally, there is a search function that allows users to quickly find a book, and the app will highlight its location within the virtual library.

This project was made to help manage a personal library in a visual and intuitive way. It was built using Unity and can be adapted for other libraries as well.
Features:

  - **Book Organization**: Add books to specific shelves in a virtual bookshelf. Books can be placed behind others when stacked in two rows.

   - **Book Details**: Add essential information like author and title for each book.

   - **Saving & Loading**: All data is saved, so the organization is preserved upon reopening the app.

   - **Search Functionality**: Find a book by its title or author, and the app highlights its location on the bookshelf.
